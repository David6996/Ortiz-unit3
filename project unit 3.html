Basketball originated from a guy named James Naismith. He came up with the game was assigned to create an indoor activity for students at the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Mass. 
Basketball was created in 1891.Naismith’s class played the first game of basket ball (two words) using a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to a balcony railing ten feet above the floor.
The gym they used to play on before was only 54 feet by 35 feet. Todays modern courts are longer, they are 94 feet by 54 feet. </p>
<p> Basketball is a team game played on a court.  Each five-person team attempts to throw or dunk an inflated ball into the opponent's basket, which is mounted on a backboard that is ten feet above the floor.  The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) is the recognized governing body for basketball world wide.  Founded in 2002, FIBA aims to create a worldwide basketball network to achieve a sustainable continuous growth of the sport of basketball.  USA Basketball, a non-profit corporation, is the national governing body for men's and women's basketball in the United States.
Basketball is a popular sport worldwide, played in professional leagues, school teams, recreational leagues, and on courts and driveways all over America.  Early evidence of the game has been found in the archeological remains of the ancient civilizations of Central and South America, but the game as we know it was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith of Pringles, Massachusetts.  He was commissioned to design an indoor team game for the YMCA.  The YWCA requested a copy of the rules in 1895, and since then, both men and woman have been participating in the sport of basketball.
The basketball court may be located indoors or outdoors, and is a rectangular hard surface.  The dimensions of the court vary according to the level of play; NCAA courts are 50x90 feet, NBA and WNBA courts are 50x94 feet, and high school courts are 50x84 feet.  The court may be constructed of a variety of materials, including wood for indoor gymnasium courts, or asphalt for outdoor courts, and must have clearly defined lines which are 5 centimeters in width.
