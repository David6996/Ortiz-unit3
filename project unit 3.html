<p>Basketball originated from a guy named James Naismith. He came up with the game was assigned to create an indoor activity for students at the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Mass. 
Basketball was created in 1891.Naismith’s class played the first game of basket ball (two words) using a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to a balcony railing ten feet above the floor.
The gym they used to play on before was only 54 feet by 35 feet. Todays modern courts are longer, they are 94 feet by 54 feet. </p>
